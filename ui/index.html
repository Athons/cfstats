<ul>
<li>CF data fetching is done in Python</li>
<li>Graphs made with <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/">Chart.js</a></li>
<li>CSS theme is <a href="https://github.com/markdowncss/splendor">Splendor</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>Data is collected by a script which reads the last weeks worth of data, daily.</p>

<p>We present the data from yesterday, as today isn't over and would show lower
numbers compared to the rest!</p>
